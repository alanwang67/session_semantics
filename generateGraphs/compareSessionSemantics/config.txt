// latency list + take the average, python library
// change everything to 24 threads max and increment by 3 ish 
// generate pdf format
// make size 3.3 inch width by 1.3 inch height 
// capitalize L and t for latency throughput and change the unit to be k & change throughput to k ops 
// make throughput and latency start with 0, start with baseline of maybe 2 threads
// change legend to be abbreviatation 
// ev, mr, rmw, mw, wfr, causal
// causal to cc 

// 10 second run with 5 to 50 workload, power of 2 to 256, 
// kill & then run 
// change clients, to get killed
